I'm a particle physics PhD student at University of Bologna and associate member of INFN. I currently works for the ATLAS experiment at CERN.

On GitHub I host all my personal projects which I develope in my free time just for fun.
- ðŸ’¬ Write me DM if you want to collaborate with one of my projects or if you need help with yours.
- :arrow_up: You can of course clone projects, raise issues and submit pull requests if you think something of my repositories should changes.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: gianluca.bianco4@unibo.it
